# Course Project API
This is the third part of the course project which combines the frontend and backend together.

**Note** Please follow the requiremnts before running any commands to make sure all dependencies have been installed and that the Environments are set up correctly.

#Backend_Instructions
1. Insdie the Backened folder run `npm install` to install all dependencies for the project api.

2. Rename the `.envRename` file to just `.env`. This will allow access to the sercet code for jwt, the port number, as well as the DataBase paths.

3. Confirm that you want to run the application on the default port `4000`. The default can be changed in the `.env` file. Locate the port variable on line 1 and set the port to whatever port you have free on your system. If somonething goes wrong the apllication will default to port `9000`.

#Frontend Instructions
